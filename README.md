## Objectives ##

This project aims at exposing you to realistic implementation of algorithmic
solutions presented in class and in particular to the greedy algorithmic approach in the context of
shortest-path problems. 

Key objectives include:
1. Developing teamwork skills by working in groups of 2-3 students (3 preferred), fostering
interpersonal and project management skills.
2. Conceive and implement a simple path-planning tool.
3. Preparing and delivering a concise demo presentation to showcase the functionalities and
interfaces developed, while enhancing your ability to prioritize and communicate essential
information effectively. This will require you to be succinct, time-conscious, and focused on
what is essential (and what is not).


## Description ##
In this project, you will create a path-planning tool to assist with urban navigation, similar to GPS-based
systems like Google Maps. However, your tool will also emphasize environmentally sustainable and
resilient mobility alternatives. The tool should support various functionalities, including identifying the
fastest and a second-fastest independent route, planning routes that exclude specific nodes or segments
(restricted routes), and creating environmentally-friendly routes that combine driving and walking with
parking options. While addressing these challenges, the tool must accommodate potential constraints,
such as the unavailability of certain routes, ensuring practical and versatile solutions for diverse mobility
needs.
